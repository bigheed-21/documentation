The White Label process has several key stages of development, and we’re outlining them all below.

## Phase 1 – Website Setup

1. **Choose your design style**  
   You will need to complete a short form (you’ll receive a link to it by email) that allows you to choose your website design style. Take this opportunity to select your font, colors, and preferred layout.
2. **Send us your logo**  
   Shortly after filling out your form, you’ll be prompted by email to send us your logo. We’ll include the exact specifications necessary to ensure a high-quality look on your site.
3. **Set-up your call to Discover the Power of the Platform**  
   Our CMS team will provide guidance on how to create a successful and beautiful website using the White Label platform. Set up your call for them to introduce you to the platform, its design possibilities and functionality.
4. **Wait for your account and website to be set up**  
   We will let you know shortly when our team has completed the set-up of your site framework and account. In the meantime, be sure that you have the following components ready to go.
   1. **A domain name for your website**  
      If you already have a domain name that you would like to use for your online bidding site, you’re all set. If you do require a domain, please reach out to whitelabel@invaluable.com.
   2. **An existing Apple Developer account**  
      If you already have an existing Apple Developer account, you can move on to the next step. If you don’t, you will need to create one in order for us to set up your iOS app. Note: This process can take up to two weeks, so we recommend that you get started now
